DatumSage: AI-Powered Conversational Data Analysis Platform
DatumSage is a full-stack, multi-user web application that empowers users to analyze and visualize their data through natural language conversation. It leverages a powerful AI agent to understand user queries, perform complex data analysis on uploaded datasets (CSV, TSV, XLSX), and generate insightful summaries and charts, making data science accessible to everyone.

(Note: You should replace this with a real screenshot of your dashboard)

‚ú® Features
Multi-Format Support: Upload and analyze datasets in various formats, including CSV, TSV, and XLSX.

Natural Language Queries: Ask complex questions about your data in plain English (e.g., "What were the top 5 selling products last month?").

AI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes a LangChain Pandas Agent with Google's Gemini Pro model to interpret questions and execute Python code on the data.

Automatic Visualizations: Instantly generate and display relevant charts and graphs (histograms, bar charts, correlation matrices) from your data.

Secure User Authentication: A complete user registration and login system using JWT for secure sessions.

Persistent Storage: User accounts and dataset metadata are securely stored in a MySQL database.

Modern UI: A sleek, responsive, and user-friendly interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
The application is built with a modern microservice architecture to separate concerns and ensure scalability.

Frontend (Main App): Next.js (React)

Handles the user interface, page routing, and acts as the main backend server.

AI Service: Python & Flask

A dedicated microservice that exposes API endpoints for all AI-powered tasks.

Database: MySQL

Stores user data, dataset information, and chat history.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18.18.0 or newer)

Python (v3.10 or newer)

[suspicious link removed]

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/datumsage-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/datumsage-app.git)
cd datumsage-app

2. Configure Environment Variables
You will need two separate .env files for this project.

a. Main Application (.env.local)

Create a file named .env.local in the root directory (datumsage-app):

# .env.local
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD='your_mysql_password'
DB_DATABASE=datumsage_db
JWT_SECRET='your_super_secret_jwt_key'
PYTHON_API_URL='http://localhost:5001'

b. Python AI Service (.env)

Create a file named .env inside the python-ai-service directory:

# python-ai-service/.env
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_ai_studio_api_key"

3. Set Up the Database
Connect to your local MySQL server.

Create the database: CREATE DATABASE datumsage_db;

Run the table creation scripts (found in the project documentation or previous setup steps).

4. Install Dependencies & Run
You will need two terminals running simultaneously.

Terminal 1: Start the Main Application (Next.js)

# In the root 'datumsage-app' folder
npm install
npm run dev

Your app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Terminal 2: Start the Python AI Service

# In the 'python-ai-service' folder
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
# source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

The AI service will be running at http://localhost:5001.

Usage
Navigate to http://localhost:3000. You will be redirected to the login page.

Create a new account and log in.

On the dashboard, upload a dataset (CSV, TSV, or XLSX).

Once uploaded, you will see a data preview and can start asking questions.

Ask a question in the query box (e.g., "What is the average age?").

Click the "Generate Charts" button to see automatic visualizations.
